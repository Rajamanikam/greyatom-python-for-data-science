### Project Overview

 # **This Project is about Deciphiring - Sample Secret Message**

## In this project, we will be applying the following concepts:

String operations
Conditional statement and loops
File I/O
Functions


### Learnings from the project

 ## Learned Things :

1. File Handling in Python
2. Join(), Split() Method Usages
3. Conditional statements
4. HigherOrderFunctions - map(), reduce(), filter() and lot more...


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Firstly , I have just  splitted the  whole problem into separate Tasks and solved them separately.  For this problem , I solved it by 7 parts. Each part is for separate task and finally the desired output is obtained :)

Part-1 : sample message reading from file & printing it out.
Part-2: reading two more messages required to get our first secret message.
Part-3:  Obtaining secret_msg_1 from performing (floor)division of two messages(in Int).
Part-4:  Using if-else condition, secret_msg_2 is Obtained
Part-5: From two different lists (a_list & b_list), secret_msg_3 is Obtained.
Part-6: Using lambda functions & other necessary conditions , secret_msg_4 is  Obtained.
Part-7: Finally by Using list of message parts, the required Secret_msg is Obtained and it is written into the file Using Write().



### Challenges faced

 ## The Mistakes & Challenges That I have Faced Are:

1. Used readLines() instead of read()
2. Separating elements that are present only in a_list and not in b_list
3.Creating a lambda function called even_word with the condition that will return true if length of x (lambda function variable) is even
4. Final_path var is not declared
5.Little little mistakes but Completed Successfully without seeing the solution :)


### Additional pointers

 _Really , It is very useful Project. I have learned lot of new essential things from it._
